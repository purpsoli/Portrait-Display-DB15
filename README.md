# Portrait-Display-DB15
A DB15 adapter board to replace the 13W3 portrait display with an easier to find cable
I made this board because i own a portrait display, but not the elusive original 13W3 to DB15 cable that came with it! 

Only two problems came with this upgrade...
1. The silk screen is upside down, you gotta build it the opposite way to what it says (I'm too lazy to fix it right now, might do it in the future)
2. You have to build your own cable! Sadly the existing DB15 cables i found never have 15 conductors so you can't use them as the 13w3 to DB15 used almost all the conductors!

BOM: COMING SOON
DA15 Connector 2057-DA15-SL-24-ND (Digikey P/N)

Instructions:
Basically just transfer everything from the original board except for the 13W3 connector (use the digikey connector)
The board isn't wide enough to use the same screw holes, you can either make some extensions or only bolt it on one side (that's what i did)
